# Operating System Roadmap

This repository contains a comprehensive roadmap for learning Operating Systems, designed for students, developers, and anyone interested in understanding how OS works at its core. The roadmap is divided into several phases, each focusing on different aspects of Operating Systems, such as process management, memory management, file systems, synchronization, concurrency, and more.

## Roadmap Phases

1. **Basics of Operating Systems**  
   Learn the core functions and types of operating systems.
   
2. **Process Management**  
   Dive into how OS handles processes and threads, process scheduling, and inter-process communication (IPC).
   
3. **Memory Management**  
   Explore memory allocation techniques, paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.
   
4. **File Systems**  
   Understand file organization, directory structures, and disk scheduling algorithms.
   
5. **Synchronization & Concurrency**  
   Master synchronization problems, mutual exclusion, semaphores, and classic concurrency problems.
   
6. **Deadlocks**  
   Learn deadlock conditions and various strategies for prevention, avoidance, and recovery.

7. **Advanced Topics**  
   Topics like virtualization, distributed systems, mobile OS, and security measures.

8. **Case Studies and Hands-on Practice**  
   Hands-on learning with Unix/Linux and Windows OS, creating custom shells, and more.

9. **Project Building**  
   Build real-world projects, contribute to open-source, and develop a custom shell or basic operating system components.

## Features

- **Structured Phases**: Step-by-step learning approach.
